[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/claerhout/testrail.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/claerhout/testrail)

TestRail is a unit test framework designed for ANSI C99 compliant programs only.
Platform-specific features are NOT supported (multi-threading in particular).
This framework is compatible with **Linux** and **OSX** platforms, Windows support is planned soon.

TODO:
* documentation (under work)
* testrail-test header comments
* makefile for submodule integration?
